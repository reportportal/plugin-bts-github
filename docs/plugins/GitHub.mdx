# GitHub

To install the GitHub plugin, see [Upload plugin](/plugins/ManagePlugins#upload-plugin) section.

Integration with the GitHub can be required for projects that collect defects in a separate tracking tool. The integration provides an exchange of information between our centralized test automation tool and the GitHub, such as posting issues and linking issues, getting updates on their statuses.

## Global GitHub integration

### Obtaining GitHub integration configuration values

#### Owner ID in BTS {#owner_id}
Owner is a company/user that owns the repository (e.g., `reportportal`)
